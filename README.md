# SHACL Form Generator

```console
npm i @ulb-darmstadt/shacl-form
```

HTML5 web component for editing/viewing [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) data that conform to [SHACL shapes](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).

## [See demo here](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/)

### Basic usage

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- load bundled web component (or when developing your own app, just do "npm i @ulb-darmstadt/shacl-form")  -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@ulb-darmstadt/shacl-form/dist/bundle.js" type="module"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
      SHACL shapes can be defined on the attribute 'data-shapes'
      or can be loaded by setting attribute 'data-shapes-url'
    -->
    <shacl-form data-shapes="
      @prefix sh:   <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
      @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
      @prefix ex:   <http://example.org#> .

      ex:ExampleShape
        a sh:NodeShape, rdfs:Class ;
        sh:property [
          sh:name 'my value' ;
          sh:path ex:exampleValue ;
          sh:maxCount 3 ;
        ] .
    "></shacl-form>

    <script>
      const form = document.querySelector("shacl-form")
      form.addEventListener('change', event => {
        // check if form data validates according to the SHACL shapes
        if (event.detail?.valid) {
          // get data graph as RDF triples and
          // log them to the browser console
          const triples = form.serialize() 
          console.log('entered form data', triples)
          // store the data somewhere, e.g. in a triple store
        }
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Element attributes

Attribute | Description
---|---
data-shapes | SHACL shape definitions (e.g. a turtle string) to generate the form from
data-shapes-url | When `data-shapes` is not set, the SHACL shapes are loaded from this URL
data-shape-subject | Optional subject (id) of the SHACL node shape to use as root for the form. If not set, the first found node shape will be used
data-values | RDF triples (e.g. a turtle string) to use as existing data graph to fill the form
data-values-url | When `data-values` is not set, the data graph triples are loaded from this URL
data-values-subject | The subject (id) of the generated data. If this is not set, a blank node with a new UUID is created. If `data-values` or `data-values-url` is set, this id is also used to find the root node in the data graph to fill the form
data-values-namespace | RDF namespace to use when generating new RDF subjects. Default is empty, so that subjects will be blank nodes.
data-values-graph | If set, serializing the form will create a named graph with the given IRI.
data-language | Language to use if shapes contain langStrings, e.g. in `sh:name` or `rdfs:label`. Default is [`navigator.language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language) with fallback to [`navigator.languages`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages)
data-loading | Text to display while the web component is initializing. Default: `"Loading..."`
data&#x2011;ignore&#x2011;owl&#x2011;imports | By default, `owl:imports` URLs are fetched and the resulting RDF triples are added to the shapes graph. Setting this attribute to any value disables this feature
data-view | When set, turns the web component into a viewer that displays the given data graph without editing functionality
data-collapse | When set, `sh:group`s and properties with `sh:node` and `sh:maxCount` != 1 are displayed in a collapsible accordion-like widget to reduce visual complexity of the form. The collapsible element is initially shown closed, except when this attribute's value is `"open"`
data-submit-button | [Ignored when `data-view` attribute is set] Whether to add a submit button to the form. The value of this attribute is used as the button label. `submit` events get emitted only when the form data validates
data-generate-node-shape-reference | When generating the RDF data graph, &lt;shacl-form&gt; can create a triple that references the root `sh:NodeShape` of the data. Suggested values for this attribute are `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type` or `http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo`. Default is empty, so that no such triple is created
data-show-node-ids | When this attribute is set, shacl node shapes will have their subject id shown in the form
data-proxy | URL of a proxy to use when fetching resources (e.g. `owl:imports`). This can help loading resources from the web that are not [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) enabled. The URL of the resource to fetch will be appended to the value of this attribute. Example value for this attribute: `http://you-proxy.org/?url=`.
data-dense | Boolean inidcating to render a compact form with small paddings and margins. Default: true

### Element functions

<a id="toRDF"></a>
```typescript
toRDF(graph?: Store): Store
```
Adds the form values as RDF triples to the given graph. If no graph object is provided, creates a new [N3 Store](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js#storing).

```typescript
serialize(format?: string, graph?: Store): string
```
Serializes the given RDF graph to the given format. If no graph object is provided, this function calls toRDF() (see above) to construct the form data graph in one of the supported [output formats](#output-formats) (default is `text/turtle`).

```typescript
validate(ignoreEmptyValues: boolean): Promise<boolean>
```
Validates the form data against the SHACL shapes graph and displays validation results as icons next to the respective input fields. If `ignoreEmptyValues` is true, empty form fields will not be marked as invalid. This function is also internally called on `change` and `submit` events.

```typescript
registerPlugin(plugin: Plugin)
```
Register a [plugin](./src/plugin.ts) to customize editing/viewing certain property values. Plugins handle specific RDF predicates or `xsd:datatype`s or both. Example: [Leaflet](./src/plugins/leaflet.ts)

```typescript
setTheme(theme: Theme)
```
Set a design theme to use for rendering. See section [Theming](#Theming).

```typescript
setClassInstanceProvider((className: string) => Promise<string>)
```
Sets a callback function that is invoked when a SHACL property has an `sh:class` definition to retrieve class instances. See [below](#classInstanceProvider) for more information.

## Features

### Validation

In edit mode, `<shacl-form>` validates the constructed data graph using the library [shacl-engine](https://github.com/rdf-ext/shacl-engine) and displays validation results as icons next to the respective form fields.

### Data graph binding

`<shacl-form>` requires only a shapes graph as input via the attribute `data-shapes` (or `data-shapes-url`) to generate an empty form and create new RDF data from the form input fields. Using the attributes `data-values` (or `data-values-url`) and `data-values-subject`, you can also bind an existing data graph to the form. The given data graph is then used to fill the form input fields.

### Viewer mode

`<shacl-form>` not only is an RDF data editor, but can also be used as a viewer by setting attribute `data-view` and binding both, a shapes and a data graph. See the [demo](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#viewer-mode) for an example.

### Providing additional data to the shapes graph

Apart from setting the element attributes `data-shapes` or `data-shapes-url`, there are two ways of adding RDF data to the shapes graph:
1. While parsing the triples of the shapes graph, any encountered `owl:imports` predicate that has a valid HTTP URL is fetched with the HTTP Accept header set to all of the [supported](#formats) MIME types. A successful response is parsed and added to a named graph. This graph is scoped (i.e. available) only to the node where the `owl:import` statement is defined on and all its sub nodes.

    The [example shapes graph](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example) contains the following triples:

    ```
    example:Attribution
      sh:property [
        owl:imports <https://w3id.org/nfdi4ing/metadata4ing/> ;
        sh:name      "Role" ;
        sh:path      dcat:hadRole ;
        sh:class     prov:Role ;
      ] .
    ```
    In this case, the URL references an ontology which among other things defines instances of class `prov:Role` that are then used to populate the "Role" dropdown in the form. The imported ontology is available only for rendering and validating this specific property.

2. <a id="classInstanceProvider"></a>The `<shacl-form>` element has a function `setClassInstanceProvider((className: string) => Promise<string>)` that registers a callback function which is invoked when a SHACL property has
an `sh:class` predicate. The expected return value is a (promise of a) string (e.g. in format `text/turtle`) that contains RDF class instance definitions of the given class.
  
    In [this example](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example), the code:
  
    ```typescript
    form.setClassInstanceProvider((clazz) => { 
      if (clazz === 'http://example.org/Material') {
        return `
          <http://example.org/steel>   a <http://example.org/Material>; <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Steel".
          <http://example.org/wood>    a <http://example.org/Material>; <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Wood".
          <http://example.org/alloy>   a <http://example.org/Material>; <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Alloy".
          <http://example.org/plaster> a <http://example.org/Material>; <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Plaster".
        `
      }}
    )
    ```
    returns instances of the class `http://example.org/Material` that are then used to populate the "Artwork material" dropdown in the form.

    A more realistic use case of this feature is calling some API endpoint to fetch class instance definitions from existing ontologies.

### Use of SHACL sh:class

In case a property shape has a `sh:class`, all available graphs are scanned for instances of the given class to let the user choose from. `rdfs:subClassOf` is also considered when building the list of class instances.

`shacl-form` also supports class instance hierarchies modelled with `skos:broader` and/or `skos:narrower`. This is illustrated by the "Subject classification" property in the [example](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example).

### SHACL constraints sh:or and sh:xone

`<shacl-form>` supports using [sh:or](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#OrConstraintComponent) and [sh:xone](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#XoneConstraintComponent) to let users select between different options on nodes or properties.
The [example shapes graph](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example) has the following triples:
```
example:Attribution
  a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:property [
    sh:maxCount  1 ;
    sh:minCount  1 ;
    sh:path prov:agent ;
    sh:or (
      [ sh:node example:Person ; rdfs:label "Person" ]
      [ sh:node example:Organisation ; rdfs:label "Organisation" ]
    )
  ] .
```
When adding a new attribution, `<shacl-form>` renders a dropdown to let the user select between the two options Person/Organisation. After selecting one of the options, the dropdown is replaced by the input fields of the selected node shape.

When binding an existing data graph to the form, the constraint is tried to be resolved depending on the respective data value:
- For RDF literals, an `sh:or` option with a matching `sh:datatype` is chosen
- For blank nodes or named nodes, the `rdf:type` of the value is tried to be matched with a node shape having a corresponding `sh:targetClass` or with a property shape having a corresponding `sh:class`. If there is no `rdf:type` but a `sh:nodeKind` of `sh:IRI`, the id of the the node is used as the value.

### Linking existing data

In case a node shape has a `sh:targetClass` and any graph, i.e.
- the shapes graph
- the data graph
- any graph loaded by `owl:imports`
- triples provided by [classInstanceProvider](#classInstanceProvider)

contains instances of that class, those can be linked in the respective SHACL property. The generated data graph will then just contain a reference to the instance, but not the triples that the instance consists of.

### SHACL shape inheritance

SHACL defines two ways of inheriting shapes: [sh:and](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#AndConstraintComponent)
and [sh:node](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#NodeConstraintComponent). `<shacl-form>` supports both. In [this example](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example), node shape `example:ArchitectureModelDataset` extends `example:Dataset` by defining the following RDF triple:

```
example:ArchitectureModelDataset sh:node example:Dataset .
```

Properties of inherited shapes are displayed first.

### Plugins

Plugins can modify rendering of the form and add functionality to edit and view certain RDF datatypes or predicates (or a combination of both). As an example, the JavaScript of [this page](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example) contains the following code:
```typescript
import { LeafletPlugin } from '@ulb-darmstadt/shacl-form/plugins/leaflet.js'
const form = document.getElementById("shacl-form")
form.registerPlugin(new LeafletPlugin({ datatype: 'http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral' }))
```
In effect, whenever a SHACL property has an `sh:datatype` of `http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral`, the plugin is called to create the editor and/or viewer HTML elements. This specific plugin uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to edit or view geometry in format [well known text](http://giswiki.org/wiki/Well_Known_Text) on a map.
Custom plugins can be built by extending class [Plugin](https://github.com/ULB-Darmstadt/shacl-form/blob/main/src/plugin.ts#L40).

### Property grouping and collapsing

Properties can be grouped using [sh:group](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#group) in the shapes graph. [This example](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/shacl-form/#example) defines a group "Physical properties" and assigns certain properties to it.

When the element attribute `data-collapse` is set, `<shacl-form>` creates an accordion-like widget that toggles the visibility of grouped properties in order to reduce the visual complexity of the form. If the grouped properties should initially be shown, set `data-collapse="open"`.

Apart from grouped properties, all properties having an `sh:node` predicate and `sh:maxCount` != 1 are collapsed.

### Supported RDF formats

#### Input formats
* text/turtle, application/n-triples, application/n-quads, application/trig using [N3 parser](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js?tab=readme-ov-file#parsing)
* application/ld+json using [jsonld](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js)
* application/rdf+xml using [rdfxml-streaming-parser](https://github.com/rdfjs/rdfxml-streaming-parser.js)

#### Output formats
<a id="output-formats"></a>

* text/turtle, application/n-triples, application/n-quads, application/trig using [N3 writer](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js?tab=readme-ov-file#writing)
* application/ld+json using [jsonld](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js)

### Use with Solid Pods

`<shacl-form>` can easily be integrated with [Solid Pods](https://solidproject.org/about). The output of `toRDF()` being a RDF/JS N3 Store, as explained [above](#toRDF), it can be presented to `solid-client`s `fromRdfJsDataset()` function, which converts the RDF graph into a Solid Dataset. The following example, based on Inrupt's basic [Solid Pod example](https://docs.inrupt.com/sdk/javascript-sdk/tutorial) shows how to merge data from a `<shacl-form>` with a Solid data resource at `readingListDataResourceURI`:
 
```js
  // Authentication is assumed, resulting in a fetch able to read and write into the Pod
  try {
    // Get data out of the shacl-form
    const form = document.querySelector('shacl-form')

    // Extract the RDF graph from the form
    const shaclFormGraphStore = await form.toRDF()

    // Convert RDF store into a Solid dataset
    const shaclFormDataset = await fromRdfJsDataset(shaclFormGraphStore)

    // First get the current dataset
    myReadingList = await getSolidDataset(readingListDataResourceURI, { fetch: fetch })

    // get all things from the shaclFormDataset
    const shaclFormThings = getThingAll(shaclFormDataset)

    // add the things from ShaclForm to the existing set
    shaclFormThings.forEach((thing) => (myReadingList = setThing(myReadingList, thing)))

    // save the new dataset
    let savedReadingList = await saveSolidDatasetAt(readingListDataResourceURI, myReadingList, {
      fetch: fetch
    })

    // Other handling here

  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Storing SHACL data from Form failed with error ${err}!`)
  }
```

### Theming

`<shacl-form>` has a built-in abstraction layer for theming, i.e. the look and feel of the form elements. If you would like to employ a different theme like e.g. `bootstrap` or `material design`, then extend class [Theme](./src/theme.ts) and call function `setTheme()` on the `<shacl-form>` element.
